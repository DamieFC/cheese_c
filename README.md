# Cheese Chess Engine (CCE)

A UCI (not yet) chess engine written in C.

## Dependancies
```
make
```

## Running
It still doesn't even do anything, why would you want to run it??? Anyway:
```bash
# Clone this repo
git clone https://github.com/cheese-chess/cheese_c
# Go into the repo (duh)
cd cheese_c
# Run make and it will compile and run automagically
make
```
