# Cheese Chess Engine (CCE)

A UCI (not yet) chess engine written in C.

## Dependancies
```
make
```

## Roadmap
This is a short-term roadmap, because I don't know how to make long ones

- [x] Implement bitboards and magic bitboards
- [x] Implement bit counter
- [ ] (In Progress) Generate piece attack bitboards
- [ ] Generate Legal Moves
- [ ] Negamax Search
= [ ] Quiescence Search

## Running
It still doesn't even do anything, why would you want to run it??? Anyway:
```bash
# Clone this repo
git clone https://github.com/cheese-chess/cheese_c
# Go into the repo (duh, if you didn't know that, you shouldn't be compiling software)
cd cheese_c
# Run make and it will compile and run automagically
make
```
